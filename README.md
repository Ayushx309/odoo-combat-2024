## Key Features

- **Robust User Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Secure login system for administrators, examiners, and invigilators.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) meticulously restricts access based on user roles, safeguarding data privacy and security.
- **Secure Paper Upload and Management:**
    - Streamlined upload process for administrators and examiners to submit examination papers.
    - Papers are encrypted upon upload to maintain confidentiality.

- **Granular Access Control and Distribution:**
    - Meticulous access control guarantees that only authorized personnel can access specific papers, preventing unauthorized viewing or modification.
    - Scheduled distribution functionality ensures papers are accessible strictly at designated exam times, minimizing the risk of exposure.
    - Comprehensive logging of all access attempts facilitates thorough auditing and examination of activity.
- **Secure Exam Paper Viewing and Download:**
    - Secure interface for authorized users to view and download examination papers.
    - Time-limited access control for downloaded papers restricts access only during the examination period, preventing leaks before or after exams.
